# WRENCH CRM - TEST TASK

## PROBLEMS

### Unable to request addresses due to CORS, tried to add proxy to package.json, added setupProxy.js

### Initially, the project was on webpack (it's strange that this is not in the commits, although I pushed, but I still have a local copy)

### The switch to CRA was due to the fact that when I installed axios, an error came out, I fixed it through Google, a new one immediately appeared, and so on, I simply could not fix the last error, so I switched to CRA so as not to waste time

## Everything else I did
